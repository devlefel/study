# High-Tech Job Interview Study Course

A comprehensive study guide for passing high-tech job interviews, focusing on Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Design.

## Curriculum

Based on "Cracking the Coding Interview" (CTCI) and top interview questions.

### 01. Data Structures & Algorithms

Implemented in Go. Each exercise is a self-contained `main.go` file that you can run to test your solution.

1.  **Big O Notation**: Understanding time and space complexity.
2.  **Arrays & Strings**: Hash tables, resizable arrays, string manipulation.
3.  **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists.
4.  **Stacks & Queues**: Implementation and usage.
5.  **Trees & Graphs**: Binary trees, BST, BFS, DFS, tries, graphs.
6.  **Bit Manipulation**: Bitwise operators and tricks.
7.  **Math & Logic Puzzles**: Prime numbers, probability, etc.
8.  **Recursion & Dynamic Programming**: Memoization, bottom-up approaches.
9.  **Sorting & Searching**: Merge sort, quick sort, binary search.

### 02. System Design

Concepts and design scenarios.

1.  **Concepts**: Scalability, Load Balancing, Caching, Sharding, CAP Theorem.
2.  **Design Scenarios**: URL Shortener, Chat System, Social Media Feed, etc.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to a topic (e.g., `01-data-structures/02-arrays-and-strings`).
2.  Read the `explanation.md`.
3.  Go to an exercise folder (e.g., `01-is-unique`).
4.  Open `main.go`.
5.  Read the problem description and implement the `Solution` function.
6.  Run `go run main.go` to verify your solution against the test cases.
